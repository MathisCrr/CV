                            <p><em>A5Sys</em> is an IT services company offering various services like software

                                manage its production, the company uses a tool: A5Prod. For my final engineering school
                                internship, I joined the A5Prod team. I am working on
                                <em>maintaining and developing new features</em> for this tool.<br>
                                A5Prod is a web application built with <em>Angular</em> and <em>PHP Symfony</em>. It
                                allows A5Sys's project managers to handle their projects from
                                creation to delivery.</p>

                            <p>I worked with the IPI team at the LS2N laboratory during my final year of engineering
                                school. They specialize in user testing, visual perception
                                modeling, and video compression optimization. Notably, the team <em>works with Netflix
                                    to improve video encoding algorithms</em>.<br>
                                In this context, the team needed <em>data to train an AI</em> to rate the quality of a
                                video from a human perception perspective. I developed a
                                <em>Python</em> algorithm to improve the quality of data collected through crowdsourcing
                                for this AI training.</p>

                                Geneva. I joined an international team working on a project called Themis. The goal of
                                this project was to simplify and improve the investment process
                                used by the business team.<br>
                                I primarily worked on the backend, using <em>Java Spring</em> and <em>Python</em>. I

                            <p>"@HeroOfTheDay" is a personal project, where I created a Twitter bot that tweets a new

                                to learn more about them. It's a fun project aimed at introducing people to new Marvel
                                heroes. To bring this project to life, I utilized a
                                <em>Python library</em>, as well as the <em>Twitter and Marvel APIs</em>. Additionally,
                                I leveraged <em>AWS Lambda</em> to schedule the bot's

                            <p>Longest is a word game where the objective is to find the longest word possible using a
                                set of given letters. To power this game, I <em>reated an
                                    API</em> that generates letters for users to play with. If a user is the first to
                                request letters from the database on any given day, the API
                                generates new letters for them. Otherwise, the API provides them with letters that are
                                already stored in the database.<br>
                                I chose to use <em>MongoDB</em> as the DBMS. For the frontend I used <em>HTML/CSS</em>
                                and <em>JavaScript</em> and for the backend and the API, I
                                utilized <em>Node.js</em>.

                                explored the impacts of humans on climate change and oceans. During
                                this event, Polytech and the Nantes School of Design (EDNA) collaborated on a joint
                                project. <br>

                                I worked with a <em>team of designers and engineers</em> to create a project centered
                                around a small, uninhabited island near Nantes that remains
                                untouched by humans. Our team <em>designed a game</em> where players use binoculars with
                                Nintendo Switch Joycon controllers integrated to take pictures of wild
                                animals on the island and learn more about them. We used a <em>Python library</em> to
                                track the movements of the binoculars and Joycon inputs.

                            <p>Zoupper is a game I developed using <em>HTML/CSS</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>. It's
                                essentially an upgraded version of Connect4, where players can remove a pawn at the
                                bottom of a line (i.e. "Zouppe" a line) instead of adding one. The game has a few rules:
                                a player cannot play on a line where their opponent has
                                Zouppe'd, and they cannot Zouppe on the same line where their opponent has just played a
                                pawn. The objective of the game is still the same - the first
                                player to align four pawns in a row wins.

                            <p>Currently, I am working as an <em>alternate student at A5Sys</em>. My primary
                                responsibility is to work on the enhancements of an internal tool that aims to

                                Prior to this, I completed a three-month <em>internship in the tech department of Pictet
                                    Asset Management</em>, where I was part of an international team that worked
                                on a solution to ease an investment process. <br>

                                Furethermore, I interned as a <em>laborer at GRDF</em> in Brest for my first engineering

                            <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in <em>computer science at Polytech Nantes</em>, a
                                French engineering school. During my academic tenure, I have gained extensive
                                knowledge of various fields in computer science, including algorithm design, programming
                                paradigms (imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logical), computer engineering,
                                database administration, computer networking, IT security, among others. <br>

                                Prior to joining Polytech Nantes, I completed a <em>two-year intensive program in
                                    CPGE</em> ("Classe Préparatoire au Grandes Ecoles"), which prepared me for the entry

                                top French engineering schools. The program included theoretical mathematics, physics,

                                Furthermore, I have got a <em>High School Diploma specialized in mathematics</em> with

                                I love <em>watching Movies and TV Series</em>. In my opinion, this medium provides us

                                to other worlds. Moreover, I firmly believe that movies and TV shows are a great way to
                                <em>enhance our creativity</em>, allowing us to <em>expand our imaginations</em> and
                                <em>see the world in new ways</em>. They can also be an effective tool for conveying

                                audiences.

                                I have always been passionate about engaging in <em>various sports</em>. Currently, I
                                have a strong interest in <em>running</em>, and I make it a point to train myself every
                                week and participate in trails whenever I can. I also enjoy other sports on a more
                                casual basis, such as <em>fitness, swimming, badminton, cycling, and more</em>.
                                As a proud Breton, I also obtained my level 1 certification in <em>scuba diving</em>.

                                <em>Gaming</em> is another one of my hobbies that I thoroughly enjoy. I play various
                                types of games, each of which <em>offers unique skills</em> to be honed such as
                                strategy,
                                communication, creativity, reflexes, organization, logic, management, and more. I
                                believe that video games provide an <em>excellent opportunity for personal
                                growth and development</em>, and I love exploring the different worlds and challenges
                                that they offer.<br>

                                Video Games are also a great way to connect with friends and forge meaningful social

                                I have a strong affinity for <em>board games</em>. I was the <em>secretary of my
                                engineering school's board games club</em>. With this club, <em>we organized a board
                                games
                                festival</em> in Nantes called the Paradice Festival.<br>

                                What I find most interesting about board games is their ability to offer diverse games.
                                Beyond the entertainment value, board games also serve as an
                                excellent way to get to know others and build strong links.<br>

                                Additionally, <em>I play chess</em>. I find it to be a highly stimulating and
                                intellectually rewarding game.

                                Recently, I have taken up <em>playing guitar</em>. Learning to play an instrument has

                                Playing guitar has also given me a new way to <em>express myself creatively</em> and
